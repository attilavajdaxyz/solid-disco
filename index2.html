    <p>this setup is <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-grid/create-your-first-css-grid">from freeCodeCamp</a>, I am plaaning to create a cool grid graphic design blog page</p>

    <h2>My Fine Links that I found about grids:</h2>
    <p>the thoughtbot application requirements - I am mastering the basics - <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/showing-off#master-the-basics">Master the Basics</a> which are 
      <ul>
        <li>design basics, principles</li>
        <li>grid systems</li>
        <li>typography</li>
      </ul>
    <p>there is <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/">Butterick's Typography https://practicaltypography.com/</a></p>
    <p>and I found a book: <a href="https://archive.org/details/typographynowtwo00poyn/page/n1/mode/2up?view=theater">TYPOGRAPHY NOW TWO</a></p>
    <p>this is good enough</p>
    <p>this is manuscript grid</p>
    <p>typography is in the page</p>

    <div class="container-third">
      <div class="d1">1</div>
      <div class="d2">2</div>
      <div class="d3">3</div>
      <div class="d4">4</div>
      <div class="d5">5</div>
    </div>

    <p>In making these simple additions to the sites I get to debug typos and different "bugs" of sorts that make the site not working, text or elements don't display etc.</p>
    <p>The Hiragana drawings are experiments with making grids and also learning hiragana by memorising characters like Sa yo u na ra is - „Åï„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™„Çâ</p>

      <div class="d1">1</div>

    <p class="grid-text">I have created this grid that is similar to the grid on the drawing and it is also responsive and changes to flexbox columns when the screen is smaller than 500px</p>

      <div class="d1"><h3>MARS 2022</h3></div>
      <div class="d2"><img src="images/IMG_0343.jpeg" alt="drawing of a cat"/></div>
      <div class="d3"><p>¬´¬†I have worked artist-to-artist with potters, photographers, poets, screenwriters, dancers, novelist, actors, directors, ‚Äî andwith those who knew only what they dreamed to be or who only dreamed of being somehow more creative.</p></div>
      <div class="d4"><p>I have seen blocked painters paint, broken poets speak in tongues, halt and lame and maimed writers racing through final drafts. I have come to not only believe but know:
        No matter what your age or your life path, whether making art is your career or your hobby or your dream, it is not too late or too egotistical or too selfish or too silly to work on your creativity.
      If you are creatively blocked ‚Äî and I believe all of us are to some extent‚Äîit is possible, even probable, that you can learn to create more freely through your willing use of the tools this book provides. Just as doing Hatha Yoga stretches alters consciousness when all you are doing is stretching, doing the exercises in this book alters consciousness when ¬´¬†all¬†¬ª you are doing is writing and playing. Do these things and a breakthrough will follow‚Äîwhether you believe in it or not.</p></div>
      <div class="d5"><img src="images/IMG_0345.jpeg" alt=""/></div>
      <div class="d6"><p> Whether you call /it/ a spiritual awakening or not.</p></div>
      <div class="d7"><img src="images/IMG_0346.jpeg" alt=""/></div>
      <div class="d8"><p>In short, the theory doesn‚Äôt matter as much as the practice itself does. What you are doing is creating pathways in your consciousness through which the creative forces can operate. Once you agree to clearing these pathways, your creativity emerges. In a sense, your creativity is like your blood. Just as blood is a fact of your physical body and nothing you invented, creativity is a fact of you spiritual body and nothing that you must invent.</p>

      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

      Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

      In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

      You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
