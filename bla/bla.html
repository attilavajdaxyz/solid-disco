        <div class="d3">Encouraged by the success attending the appearance of PIANO MASTERY, Volume 1, a Second Series of Talks with great pianists and teachers has been prepared, at the request of
            the publishers.</div>
        <div class="d4">In arranging the present volume, it was desired to include not only those who have become known to fame, but also those of the younger school of pianists who have achieved
            recognitionforspecialgifts. Anumberofthe latter have been included in the present vol-
            ume. Lack of space, however, has prevented the inclusion of many more rising young artists who otherwise would surely have found a place in this collection.</div>
